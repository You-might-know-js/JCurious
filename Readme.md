# What is JCurious?

JCurious will be your implementation of JQuery, kind of. JQuery has a lot of bloat, but comes will a lot of cool features. In this you will be building out a more-modern, less fleshed-out version of jQuery. It will be written in ES6, using modules, and be modular in the sense that you will be able to import specific sections without requiring the whole application

I'm not going to list out all the specs now because this will be something you'll work on concurrently as you feel like it once you know ES6. THe main things to worry about including are this though

1. A method that is similar to how jQuery gets elements, so basically an abstraction of querySelector, querySelectorAll, and getElementById.
2. An abstraction for making AJAX requests using fetch by default but switching to XMLRequest if fetch is not supported


We might also add some new features to the library, things like observables with getters and setters like you'd see in Vue, building out a basic client-side routing library and things like that.


Like I said, these projects are not easy and are definitely a step up from what you have done in the past and that is okay. These aren't projects you knock out in a single afternoon even if you are a very experienced dev. It's okay to take your time and struggle with these. I'll add more features to this as we go.

Also, don't worry, you're ready.
